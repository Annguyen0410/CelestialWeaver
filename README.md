## 📱 About

**Celestial Weaver** is an immersive arcade game that combines precise timing mechanics with stunning cosmic visuals. Players take on the role of a cosmic weaver, tapping golden orbs as they spiral inward toward orbital rings. With each successful capture, you leave behind temporal rifts that can be activated for bonus rewards.

The game features progressive difficulty, power-ups, boss encounters, and a comprehensive achievement system that tracks your cosmic journey.
